# FerroX
FerroX is a massively parallel, 3D phase-field simulation framework for modeling ferroelectric materials based scalable logic devices. We  self-consistently solve the time-dependent Ginzburg Landau (TDGL) equation for ferroelectric polarization, Poisson's equation for electric potential, and semiconductor charge equation for carrier densities in semiconductor regions. The algorithm is implemented using Exascale Computing Project software framework, AMReX, which provides effective scalability on manycore and GPU-based supercomputing architectures. The code can be used for simulations of ferroelectric domain-wall induced negative capacitance (NC) effect in Metal-Ferroelectric-Insulator-Metal (MFIM) and Metal-Ferroelectric-Insulator-Semiconductor-Metal (MFISM) devices.
# Getting Help
Our community is here to help. Please report installation problems or general questions about the code in the github [Issues](https://github.com/AMReX-Microelectronics/FerroX/issues) tab above.
# Installation
## Download AMReX Repository
``` git clone git@github.com:AMReX-Codes/amrex.git ```
## Download FerroX Repository
``` git clone git@github.com:AMReX-Microelectronics/FerroX.git ```
## Build
Make sure that the AMReX and FerroX are cloned in the same location in their filesystem. Navigate to the Exec folder of FerroX and execute
```make -j 4``` for a GPU build and ```make -j 4 USE_CUDA=FALSE``` for a CPU build.

# Running FerroX
Example input scripts are located in `Examples` directory. 
## Simple Testcase
You can run the following to simulate a MFIM heterostructure with a 5 nm HZO as the ferroelectric layer and 4 nm alumina as the dielectric layer under zero applied voltage:
## For MPI+OMP build
```mpirun -n 4 ./main3d.gnu.TPROF.MPI.OMP.ex Examples/inputs_mfim_Noeb```
## For MPI+CUDA build
```mpirun -n 4 ./main3d.gnu.TPROF.MPI.CUDA.ex Examples/inputs_mfim_Noeb```
# Visualization and Data Analysis
Refer to the following link for several visualization tools that can be used for AMReX plotfiles.

### Data Analysis in Python using yt 
You can extract the data in numpy array format using yt (you can refer to this for installation and usage of [yt](https://yt-project.org/). After you have installed yt, you can do something as follows, for example, to get variable 'Pz' (z-component of polarization)
```
import yt
ds = yt.load('./plt00001000/') # for data at time step 1000
ad0 = ds.covering_grid(level=0, left_edge=ds.domain_left_edge, dims=ds.domain_dimensions)
P_array = ad0['Pz'].to_ndarray()
```
