# Imposed external heating test (planar)

This is a simple one-dimensional (although implemented in 2D) test that has an exact analytical solution so should pick up some fundamental problems.

A time-dependent imposed heat source is applied to a box with impenetrable upper and lower boundaries that is subject to a uniform constant gravity. The density, pressure and velocity can be determined analytically.

Details of the test and a comparison of the numerical and analytical solutions
can be found in a jupyter notebook here.
