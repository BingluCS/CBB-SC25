double_bubble/

 Bubble rise problem using the multigamma EOS and null reactions


incomp_shear_jet/

  A simple pure-incompressible shear layer problem.  This is the 
  example problem used in Bell, Colella, and Glaz (1989).

reacting_bubble/
 
  The test problem from the Maestro paper III.  This places 3 hots
  spots in a plane-parallel atmosphere.  Burning makes these bubbles
  buoyant, and then roll up.

  This also contains the inputs files used in the multilevel Maestro
  paper to show adaptivity in the problem.  

  Note: this problem setup was previously called test2
 

rt/

  A classic Rayleigh-Taylor instability problem.


test_convect/

  Drive convection through a plane-parallel atmosphere using an
  externally-specified heat source.  This problem was used to compare
  with compressible solvers in Maestro paper III and to test the
  multilevel algorithm in the multilevel paper.
